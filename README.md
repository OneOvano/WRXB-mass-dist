  catalogs/WROB - "WR+OB close binaries of MW, LMC and SMC catalog" by Shaposhnikov (in progress)

catalogs/updates - last updates for some objects parameters estimation

dist-testing.ipynb - testing distribution recovery algorithms on artificial distributions

WRXB-mass-dist.ipynb - code for constructing mass distributions for WR stars and compact objects in CBS. Conceptually contains the following elements:

  1) Data preparation: combining data from available catalogs, extracting necessary features

  2) Simple methods for analyzing distributions: histograms, KDE, sum of individual probability distributions. Testing hypotheses about the same mass distribution for HMXB and LMXB, statistical assessment of the significance of the "mass dip" (~2-5 solar masses), data grouping

  3) Methods for reconstructing distributions based on neural networks - VAE, GAN, NF (in progress)

  4) Comparison of the results of simple and complex methods, final reconstruction of distributions

  5) Construction of the mass distribution of CO cores of WR stars at the time of collapse. The calculation is based on simple relationships, includes mass loss
  
  6) Comparison of the constructed mass distributions for NS, BH and WR's CO-cores in TDS, construction of a possible transformation from the mass distribution of CO-cores to the mass distribution of compact objects

  7) Conclusions
